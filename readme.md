### Can I exclude the Archived status from appearing on certain post types? ###
Yes, you can do this by using the `aps_excluded_post_types` filter:

<pre lang="php">
function my_aps_excluded_post_types( $post_types ) {
	$post_types[] = 'my_custom_post_type';

	return $post_types;
}
add_filter( 'aps_excluded_post_types', 'my_aps_excluded_post_types', 10, 1 );
</pre>
